## **XII. Implementation Roadmap**

This section outlines the staged execution plan for building, launching, and scaling the ARA agent — from core prototype to full cognitive deployment.

| Stage            | Duration | Goal                                             | Status / Done                                      | Depends On        |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Design           | 3 days   | Architecture, documentation, signal map         | ARU-AGI architecture, `bootstrap` file, `.md` spec | —                  |
| Core MVP         | 7 days   | SignalEngine, QMemory, FanthomEngine             | CLI agent running: thoughts → memory → reaction    | Design             |
| WebCLI           | 2 days   | Web interface via Fiber (React, Tailwind)        | Text input = signal, real-time engine response     | Core MVP           |
| Telegram Bot     | 1 day    | Local ARA agent via Telegram                     | ARA replies in chat, phantoms triggered            | Core MVP           |
| LLM Integration  | 5 days   | GPT API module (user-provided key)               | Fallback or direct GPT call in logic chain         | Core MVP           |
| ExpansionEngine  | 5 days   | Generalization, suggestions, passive thinking    | ARA forms ideas without prompt                     | LLM, Memory        |
| HumanNodes       | 5 days   | Evaluation interface, thought review             | Quality metric, UX for reviewers                   | ExpansionEngine    |
| EnterpriseSync   | 5 days   | HeadAgent, p2p goal coordination                 | QBit / Phantom / Mission exchange                  | Core MVP           |
| Finalization     | 7 days   | UI, GitHub Pages, documentation, public demo     | Website live, public MVP build                     | All of the above   |

### 🧠 Notes

- All modules are modular and swappable;
- Priorities can shift depending on feedback from HumanNodes;
- Roadmap supports both CLI-focused MVP and visual SaaS extension.

### ✅ Milestone Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning                            |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| ✅     | Fully implemented and working       |
| 🛠     | In progress or under review         |
| 🔜     | Scheduled, not started              |
| ❌     | Not yet confirmed or prioritized    |

#### Conclusion

This roadmap reflects not just a build plan,  
but a **path to digital cognition** —  
one milestone at a time.

> The future of thinking is being built — structurally, modularly, and semantically.
