## **IX. Interfaces and Usage Modes**

---

### 9.1. CLI Agent (Terminal Mode)

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) is the **default and simplest way to run ARA locally**.  
It turns the terminal into a **direct signal interface**, where:

- user inputs are converted to structured signals,
- responses are generated by local reasoning,
- the entire interaction is **offline and self-contained**.

---

#### 📌 Purpose

- Provide low-overhead local interface for ARA;
- Enable full agent operation without GUI;
- Support development, testing, and headless deployment.

---

### ⚙️ Architecture

```bash
$ ./ara start
ARA initialized in CLI mode.
Enter command or message:
> what should I focus on today?
````

Behind the scenes:

```go
func RunCLI() {
    for {
        input := ReadLine()
        signal := Signalize(input)
        ARA.Process(signal)
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Signal Flow in CLI

| Step       | Description                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| User input | Parsed as signal with type `"query"`          |
| Signal     | Routed to `FlowEngine` → `MemoryEngine`       |
| Thought    | May trigger suggestion, phantom, or reasoning |
| Response   | Rendered back in terminal as text             |

---

### 🔁 Features

| Feature                | Available                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Offline mode           | ✅ (no network dependency)            |
| Memory persistence     | ✅ (`msgpack`, `leveldb`)             |
| Phantom activation     | ✅ (when confidence is low)           |
| CLI prompt enhancement | ✅ (`emotion`, `tags`, `goal` markup) |

---

### 🧩 Example CLI Session

```bash
> how do I resolve task switching fatigue?

[ARA Suggestion]
"Would you like to break this into focused 25-minute blocks?
Your goal ‘optimize_workflow’ matches this pattern."
```

```bash
> add note: reflect on failure patterns

[Memory]
Stored QBit: "reflect_on_failure_patterns" → tagged ["introspection"]
```

---

### 🔐 CLI Security and Identity

* Local-only; no data leaves the machine.
* Memory is encrypted if `MemoryEncryption = true`.
* `SelfKernel` identity loaded from disk:

```go
SelfKernel{
    AgentID: "ARA::cli::u01",
    CoreMission: "Assist user via terminal cognition",
}
```

---

### ✅ CLI Use Cases

| Scenario                      | Benefit                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer testing agent logic | Full control, live memory introspection             |
| Secure private thinking       | Full offline mode, local-only storage               |
| Embedded terminal UI          | Integration into server apps, scripts, OS utilities |

---

#### Conclusion

The CLI mode turns your terminal into a **thinking partner** —
fully local, fast, interpretable, and programmable.

> When no GUI is needed and cognition must remain private — **CLI is the signal line to your agent’s mind**.

---
---

### 9.2. Telegram Bot (Local Chat Intelligence)

ARA can be run as a **Telegram bot**, acting as a local intelligent agent that responds to messages directly in chat.  
This interface is ideal for **daily use**, lightweight interaction, and mobile environments — all while preserving privacy and semantic depth.

---

#### 📌 Purpose

- Provide a chat-based natural language interface to ARA;
- Enable remote, asynchronous interaction without GUI;
- Support portable intelligence via smartphone or desktop Telegram;
- Preserve offline/local-first architecture where possible.

---

### ⚙️ Architecture

ARA Telegram bot runs via a local server:

```bash
$ ./ara serve --mode=telegram
````

It connects to the Telegram Bot API but **does not store or process anything in the cloud**.

---

### 🧠 Signal Flow in Telegram Mode

1. Message is received from user;
2. Converted into a structured `Signal`;
3. Routed through `FlowEngine`, `MemoryEngine`, `Suggestor`;
4. Response is sent back via chat.

```go
func HandleTelegramMessage(text string) {
    signal := Signalize(text)
    response := ARA.Process(signal)
    Telegram.Send(response)
}
```

---

### 📋 Example Session

```
User: I feel stuck again this week...

ARA: Would you like to analyze the pattern behind these low cycles?
Your recent goals ‘regain_focus’, ‘reduce_anxiety’ are still open.
```

---

it becomes a **semantic backend for cognition**, embeddable in anything.

> From a chatbot to a complex system — if it can send a signal, it can **think through ARA**.

---
---

### 9.5. Local Notifications and OS Integration

ARA supports **OS-level interaction** by delivering local system notifications and integrating with desktop or server environments.

This allows ARA to:

- alert the user when relevant signals or goals activate,
- deliver phantom suggestions passively,
- synchronize with system-level schedules, files, or commands,
- run silently in the background as a cognitive daemon.

---

#### 📌 Purpose

- Make ARA perceptible beyond the terminal or chat;
- Enable **ambient cognition** — the agent thinks while you work;
- React to system events (timeouts, errors, external triggers);
- Deliver insights at the right moment via native notifications.

---

### ⚙️ Notification Example (macOS / Linux / Windows)

```bash
[ARA Notification]
"Your goal ‘finalize_report’ hasn’t progressed in 36h.
Consider breaking it into subgoals?"
````

This is triggered by a `WillEngine` signal and delivered via native OS notification APIs:

* `notify-send` (Linux)
* `osascript` or `terminal-notifier` (macOS)
* `ToastNotifier` (Windows)

---

### 🧠 System Event Integration

| Event Type                | ARA Response Example                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| File saved to project dir | Trigger signal: `project_modified` → suggest goal update   |
| App crash detected        | Log phantom: `"analyze instability in process chain"`      |
| User idle for 30+ min     | Prompt: `"Resume goal ‘deep_focus’? Activate flow timer?"` |
| New calendar event        | Create QBit: `"incoming_context_shift"`                    |

---

### 🔁 System Hooks (Optional)

| Integration | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crontab`   | Schedule periodic goal reminders or phantom evaluations |
| `fswatch`   | React to file or folder changes                         |
| `dbus`      | Monitor system bus for user-defined triggers            |
| `keybind`   | Manual activation via keyboard shortcut                 |

---

### 🔐 Privacy & Control

* User can enable/disable categories of notifications;
* ARA respects `DoNotDisturb`, time-of-day, and goal priority;
* Local logs are timestamped and user-visible.

```yaml
notifications:
  enabled: true
  do_not_disturb_hours: [22, 7]
  types: ["goal", "phantom", "system"]
```

---

### 🧠 Ambient Use Cases

| Scenario                    | ARA Behavior                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deep work session           | Minimal interrupt mode; only critical signals appear      |
| Planning day                | Phantom suggestions triggered on calendar context         |
| Cognitive fatigue detection | Suggests pause or reflection chain                        |
| Daily wrap-up               | Agent summarizes memory changes and goal state via pop-up |

---

#### Conclusion

With OS-level integration, ARA becomes a **background cognitive presence** —
not distracting, but ever-aware.

> It’s your second mind — silently observing, gently suggesting, intelligently nudging.

---
